Firms which accept multi-day orders should consider embedding a date within the ExecID field to assure uniqueness across days. (Prior to FIX 4.1 this field was of type int). | ExecID       |
| 18           | ExecInst   | MultipleCharValue | Instructions for order handling on exchange trading floor. If more than one instruction is applicable to an order, this field can contain multiple instructions separated by space. \*\*\* SOME VALUES HAVE BEEN REPLACED - See "Replaced Features and Supported Approach" \*\*\* (see Volume : "Glossary" for value definitions)                                                                                         | ExecInst     |

# Instrument Description

Any other value or the absence of this field should cause the respondent to default to the active issue.

Additionally the following patterns may be used as well as enum values:

- Dx = FX tenor expression for "days", e.g. "D5", where "x" is any integer > 0
- Mx = FX tenor expression for "months", e.g. "M3", where "x" is any integer > 0
- Wx = FX tenor expression for "weeks", e.g. "W13", where "x" is any integer > 0
- Yx = FX tenor expression for "years", e.g. "Y1", where "x" is any integer > 0

Noted that for FX the tenors expressed using Dx, Mx, Wx, and Yx values do not denote business days, but calendar days.

RoundingDirection char Specifies which direction to round For CIV - indicates whether or not the quantity of shares/units is to be rounded and in which direction where CashOrdQty (152) or (for CIV only) OrderPercent (516) are specified on an order.

The default is for rounding to be at the discretion of the executing broker or fund manager. e.g. for an order specifying CashOrdQty or OrderPercent if the calculated number of shares/units was 325.76 and RoundingModulus (469) was 0 - "round down" would give 320 units, 1 - "round up" would give 330 units and "round to nearest" would give 320 units.

An indicative quote is used to inform a counterparty of a market. An indicative quote does not result directly in a trade.

A tradeable quote is submitted to a market and will result directly in a trade against other orders and quotes in a market.

A restricted tradeable quote is submitted to a market and within a certain restriction (possibly based upon price or quantity) will automatically trade against orders. Orders that do not comply with restrictions are sent to the quote issuer who can choose to accept or decline the order.

A counter quote is used in the negotiation model. See Volume 7 - Product: Fixed Income for example usage.

This is primarily used when sending orders to Japanese exchanges to indicate sell margin or buy to cover. The same tag could be assigned also by buy-side to indicate the intent to sell or buy margin and the sell-side to accept or reject (base on some validation criteria) the margin request. | CshMgn    |

| 1 - Cross AON - cross trade which is executed completely or not. Both sides are treated in the same manner. This is equivalent to an "All or None".                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                          |        |                                                                            |               |
| 2 - Cross IOC - cross trade which is executed partially and the rest is cancelled. One side is fully executed, the other side is partially executed with the remainder being cancelled. This is equivalent to an IOC on the other side. Note: CrossPrioritization(550) field may be used to indicate which side should fully execute in this scenario.       |                          |        |                                                                            |               |
| 3 - Cross One Side - cross trade which is partially executed with the unfilled portions remaining active. One side of the cross is fully executed (as denoted by the CrossPrioritization (550) field), but the unfilled portion remains active.                                                                                                              |                          |        |                                                                            |               |
| 4 - Cross Same Price - cross trade is executed with existing orders with the same price. In this case other orders exist with the same price, the quantity of the Cross is executed against the existing orders and quotes, the remainder of the cross is executed against the other side of the cross. The two sides potentially have different quantities. |                          |        |                                                                            |               |

| The definition of prioritization is left to the market. In some markets prioritization means which side of the cross order is applied to the market first. In other markets - prioritization may mean that the prioritized side is fully executed (sometimes referred to as the side being protected).                                                       |                          |        |                                                                            |               |

derivatives and specify a magnitude (such as, MM, Kilo, M, etc.) and the dimension (such as, watt hours, BTU's) to produce standard fixed measures (such as MWh - Megawatt-hours, MMBtu - One million BTUs).

The second group, Variable Quantity UOMs, specifies the dimension as a single unit without a magnitude (or more accurately a magnitude of one) and uses the UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) field to define the quantity of units per contract. Variable Quantity UOMs are used for both commodities (such as lbs of lean cattle, bushels of corn, ounces of gold) and financial futures.

Examples:

- For lean cattle futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure of 'lbs' with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 40,000, means each lean cattle futures contract represents 40,000 lbs of lean cattle.
- For Eurodollars futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure of USD with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 1,000,000, means a Eurodollar futures contract represents 1,000,000 USD.
- For gold futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure is oz_tr (Troy ounce) with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 1,000, means each gold futures contract represents 1,000 troy ounces of gold.

Valid values:

Fixed Magnitude UOM
Bcf - Billion cubic feet
MMbbl - Million Barrels ( Deprecated in FIX.5.0SP1 )
MMBtu - One Million BTU
MWh - Megawatt hours

Variable Quantity UOM
Bbl - Barrels
Bu - Bushels
lbs - pounds
Gal - Gallons
oz_tr - Troy Ounces

# Appendix 6-A

# Valid Currency Codes

Currency codes used in FIX are those defined in ISO 4217 standard. To obtain the current valid list please contact the ISO 4217 secretariat at +44-181-996-9000 or on World Wide Web at:

http://www.bsi.org.uk/bsi/products/standards/products/currency.xhtml

Another online reference at the time of this writing is: http://www.xe.com/iso4217.htm

Note: Prices defined in FIX messages should be made consistent with the currency code used. In some markets, prices are quoted as multiples or fractions of the currency, FIX messages should normalize the amount to coincide with the indicated code (e.g. UK securities are quoted in pence but must be represented in FIX messages as pounds).

# Appendix 6-C

# Exchange Codes - ISO 10383 Market Identifier Code (MIC)

As of FIX 4.3, Exchange Codes used in FIX are those defined in ISO 10383 standard: Market Identifier Code (MIC). The cross-reference list below is a subset of ISO 10383 values as of the time of this publication. It is provided to facilitate the transition from the Reuters exchange suffix codes which versions of FIX prior to FIX 4.2 were based upon. The official standard and set of values are maintained by the ISO 10383 standard and any discrepancies below should be considered typographical errors using the ISO 10383 standard as the correct set of values. These values are maintained by ISO 10383 secretariat (see "Appendix 6-B") and as of the time of this publication the website link to view current list of MIC values is: http://www.iso15022.org/MIC/homepageMIC.htm

Note that "Old FIX 4.2" values which are underlined represent "numeric codes" assigned by the FIX organization in lieu of a valid Reuters exchange suffix. Such values which have a valid MIC value should use the MIC value. Markets without a MIC value should apply to the ISO 10383 Registration Authority (SWIFT) for an appropriate value. The FIX organization will maintain numeric values for required market identifiers which are unable to establish a MIC value for some reason.

Disclaimer: Please refer to the current ISO 10383 standard for the complete list. The following list is a subset and designed primarily to support cross-referencing mapping from FIX versions &#x3C;= 4.2 to FIX versions >= 4.3 (when the FIX specification standard changed from Reuters exchange suffix to ISO 10383 MIC code).

# Appendix 6-D

# CFICode Usage - ISO 10962 Classification of Financial Instruments (CFI code)

As of FIX 4.3, the CFICode field was added to the FIX Protocol in an attempt to provide a standards-based source of security type values by using values defined in ISO 10962 standard: Classification of Financial Instruments (CFI code). Prior to FIX 4.3, the SecurityType field was used to identify security types and was based upon a set of values published by ISITC (International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication) which ISITC no longer maintains.

It is recommended that CFICode be used instead of SecurityType for non-Fixed Income instruments as it is based upon an ISO standard and supports non-Fixed Income products in a manner consistent with the needs of FIX Protocol users. As of FIX 4.3, the SecurityType field was expanded and re-organized to support the requirements of Fixed Income products for FIX Protocol users, as the present ISO 10962 standard did not meet those needs.

ISO 10962 is maintained by ANNA (Association of National Numbering Agencies) acting as Registration Authority. See "Appendix 6-B FIX Fields Based Upon Other Standards". See also the Product (460) and SecurityType (167) fields.

A subset of ISO 10962 values applicable to FIX usage are identified below. The official standard and set of possible values are maintained by the ISO 10962 standard and any discrepancies below should be considered typographical errors using the ISO 10962 standard as the correct set of values. To obtain the ISO 10962 standard, please contact the ISO 10962 secretariat (see "Appendix 6-B") and/or visit the ISO website at http://www.iso.ch.

The ISO 10962 standard defines a 6 character code in which each character’s position value carries a special significance (attribute) and set of values. Note that "X" represents an unspecified or unknown attribute, thus it is not always necessary to specify every attribute (character position value).

# Appendix 6-E

# Deprecated (Phased-out) Features and Supported Approach

Certain features of the FIX Protocol that were implemented in earlier versions of the FIX Protocol specification, have been replaced by a different approach. Such features have been labeled as "Deprecated" throughout the FIX Specification document. This means that feature is being phased out, systems that implement the FIX Protocol should be adjusted to use the new, supported approach, and the next version of the FIX Specification will remove the feature altogether.

The rationale behind deprecating a feature is based upon either:

- Actual use and implementation of the feature identified major shortcomings necessitating a re-design.
- Additional business requirements have been identified which the feature is unable to expand and properly support in its present form.

The new, supported approach for each deprecated feature is identified below:

1. Deprecated Field: TotalAccruedInterestAmt (tag 540) [deprecated in FIX 4.4]

The TotalAccruedInterestAmt field introduced in FIX 4.3 has been replaced by the FIX 4.4-introduced AllocAccruedInterestAmt (742) field for the allocation-level value. Note that AccruedInterestAmt (tag 159) represents the block-level (total). Affects Allocation messaging.
2. Deprecated the use of SettlCurrAmt (119) and SettlCurrency (120) fields within Allocation messaging NoAllocs repeating group [deprecated in FIX 4.4]

AllocSettlCurrAmt (737) and AllocSettlCurrency (736) fields should be used instead of SettlCurrAmt (119) and SettlCurrency (120) within the NoAllocs repeating group. Affects Allocation messaging.
3. Deprecated Instrument-affiliated "RedemptionDate" Fields: RedemptionDate (240), UnderlyingRedemptionDate (247), and LegRedemptionDate (254). [deprecated in FIX 4.4]

Deprecated RedemptionDate (240) from <instrument>, UnderlyingRedemptionDate (247) from <underlyinginstrument>, and LegRedemptionDate (254) from <instrumentleg>. YieldRedemptionDate (696) in <yielddata> component block should be used instead.
</yielddata></instrumentleg></underlyinginstrument></instrument>

# 4.  Deprecated usage of the Settlement Instruction message where used to refer to an allocation message [deprecated in FIX 4.4]

The main body of the Settlement Instruction (now a component block) has been added to the allocation and confirmation messages (Allocation Instruction, Allocation Report and Confirmation).

# 5.  Deprecated various FIX 4.3-introduced "Repo" Fields [deprecated in FIX 4.4]

Deprecated the following fields from <instrument>, <underlyinginstrument>, and <leginstrument> component blocks: RepoCollateralSecurityType (239), RepurchaseTerm (226), RepurchaseRate (227), UnderlyingRepoCollateralSecurityType (243), UnderlyingRepurchaseTerm (244), UnderlyingRepurchaseRate (245), LegRepoCollateralSecurityType (250), LegRepurchaseTerm (251), LegRepurchaseRate (252). The RepoCollateralSecurityType (239) field is satisfied with UnderlyingSecurityType (310), RepurchaseTerm (226) by TerminationType (788), RepurchaseRate (227) by Price (44).

# Appendix 6-F

# Replaced Features and Supported Approach

Certain features of the FIX Protocol which were implemented in earlier versions of the FIX Protocol specification, have been removed and replaced by a different approach. Such features have been labeled as "Removed" or "Replaced" throughout the FIX Specification document. The removed or replaced feature is no longer supported by this version of the FIX Protocol specification.

These features may or may not have been "Deprecated" in a previous version. Deprecation implies that implementations must support both approaches during the deprecation period. Removing and replacing a features without a deprecation period is based upon:

- Supporting both approaches would result in a high degree of complexity and/or ambiguity.

The rationale behind removing a feature is based upon either:

- Actual use and implementation of the feature identified major shortcomings necessitating a re-design.
- Additional business requirements have been identified which the feature is unable to expand and properly support in its present form.

The new, supported approach for each removed feature is identified below:

| 1. Replaced Field:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   | ExecTransType (tag 20) and values in ExecType and OrdStatus fields |

| The ExecTransType field introduced in FIX 2.7 has been removed and its values have been incorporated within the ExecType field. The ExecType field introduced in FIX 4.1 has had several values removed and a new value to represent the combination of the removed values. The ExecTransType and ExecType fields have effectively been merged into the ExecType field thus the removal of ExecTransType. Each field attempted to designate the type of Execution Report message received in a slightly different way. Both fields were designated as required. This became confusing and should be simplified by a single, merged field with the following mapping table: |   |                                                                    |

Replaced Fields: MaturityDay (tag 205) and UnderlyingMaturityDay (tag 314) [Replaced in FIX 4.3]

The MaturityDay field (tag 205) introduced in FIX 4.1 has been removed and replaced by the MaturityDate field (tag 541). The MaturityMonthYear field (tag 200) can still be used for standardized derivatives which are typically only referenced by month and year (e.g. S&#x26;P futures).

The UnderlyingMaturityDay field (tag 314) introduced in FIX 4.2 has been removed and replaced by the UnderlyingMaturityDate field (tag 542). The UnderlyingMaturityMonthYear field (tag 313) can still be used for standardized derivatives which are typically only referenced by month and year (e.g. S&#x26;P futures).

The ExecBroker (tag 76), BrokerOfCredit (tag 92), ClientID (tag 109), ClearingFirm (tag 439), ClearingAccount (tag 440), and SettlLocation (tag 166) fields introduced prior to FIX 4.3 have been removed and the equivalent values can now be specified via PartyRole, PartyID, and PartyIDSource. In addition this  "component block" (see Volume 1: "Common Components of Application Messages") is flexible enough to allow new "roles" or types of firm identification to be specified without a corresponding increase in the number of FIX fields. All of the old field values can be specified via the following mapping table:</parties>

# 6. Replaced Field Enumerations for Futures and Options

The SecurityType (tag 167) has been replaced with CFICode (tag 461) [Replaced in FIX 4.3]. The CFICode was introduced to improve granularity in specifying security type. The adoption of CFICode has made the values for futures and options in SecurityType (tag 167) redundant.

# 5. Replaced Field: PutOrCall (tag 201) and UnderlyingPutOrCall (tag 315) with CFICode (tag 461) [Replaced in FIX 4.3]

The CFICode was introduced to improve granularity in specifying security type. The adoption of CFICode has made the PutOrCall (tag 201) redundant. The PutOrCall values are numeric and this has led to confusion on their usage as the data is not self describing. The CFICode uses a more readable format of “P” and “C” for put and call.

PutOrCall values can be specified using CFICode via the following mapping table:

| Removed field             | CFICode (tag 461) value                                          |

| 0                         | First position of CFICode = “O” Second position of CFICode = “P” |
| 1                         | First position of CFICode = “O” Second position of CFICode = “C” |

# 6. Replaced Field: CustomerOrFirm (tag 204) with OrderCapacity (tag 528) [Replaced in FIX 4.3]

The Rule80A (tag 47) and CustomerOrFirm (tag 204) values have been merged and generalized into the new OrderCapacity (tag 528) field. This was done to provide a more generalized approach to identifying order capacity across markets.

CustomerOrFim values can be specified using OrderCapacity via the following mapping table:

| Removed Field                   | OrderCapacity (tag 528) value |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| CustomerOrFirm (tag 204) values |                               |

Replaced values: OptAttribute (tag 206) with values in CFICode (tag 461) [Replaced in FIX 4.3]

The CFICode (tag 461) permits specification of the expiration style for options using more meaningful acronyms “A” for American and “E” for European. These values will replace the values currently used by some markets in the OptAttribute field. OptAttribute will still be used for versioning the option contract in the event of a corporate action, such as a split or merger, but will eliminate the problem when both the expiration style and a version number must be specified.

Certain OptAttribute values can be specified using CFICode via the following mapping table:

| Values Removed From OptAttribute (tag 206) | CFICode (tag 461)                                                                              |

| L American                                 | First Position “O” Second Position “C” or “P” Third Position “A” for American Style Expiration |
| S European                                 | First Position “O” Second Position “C” or “P” Third Position “E” for European Style Expiration |

Replaced values: AllocTransType (tag 71) with values in AllocType (tag 626) [Replaced in FIX 4.3]

The AllocTransType (tag 71) field specified both the type of "transaction": new, cancel, replace and the type or purpose of the Allocation message. A new field AllocType was introduced in FIX 4.3 which specifies the type or purpose of the Allocation message. Three fields were removed from AllocTransType and are now part of AllocType. In addition, AllocType supports additional values which were not defined in AllocTransType.

Certain AllocTransType values can be specified using AllocType via the following mapping table:

The RelatdSym (tag 46) field used in the News and Email messages prior to FIX 4.3 has been replaced by the Symbol (tag 55) field thus allowing the News and Email messages to use the same &#x3C;Instrument> component block as other FIX application messages.

# 10. Removed Deprecated Field:

# 11. Removed Deprecated "On Close"-related Values for OrdType Field

[Deprecated in FIX 4.3, Removed in FIX 4.4]

Affected Volume 1: Glossary, Business Terms. Affected Volume 6: values removed from OnClose field in Field Definitions.

© Copyright, 2008-20092011, FIX Protocol, Limited                                     Page 458 of 482

Version 5.0 Service Pack 2 - Errata VOLUME 6 August 18, 2011

# 1. Deprecated OrdType Values

Three "on close"-related values in the OrdType field were deprecated in FIX 4.3 by the combined use of a new TimeInForce "At the Close" value and OrdType values. These OrdType values were removed in FIX 4.4. This makes "On close" handling consistent with "On open" (as a TimeInForce vs. OrdType). Note that CMS (e.g. used by NYSE) uses a TimeInForce for On Open (OPG) and an OrdType for On Close. FIX 4.3 implemented a consistent handling of the two vs. a continuation of following CMS-based semantics. Mapping of the deprecated OrdType field's values is as follows:

| Replaced Value within OrdType field | TimeInForce (59) | OrdType (38) |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 5 Market on close                   | 7 "At the Close" | 1 "Market"   |
| A On close                          | 7 "At the Close" | 1 "Market"   |
| B Limit on close                    | 7 "At the Close" | 2 "Limit"    |

# 12. Removed Deprecated Field: Rule80A

Rule80A (tag 47) [Deprecated and Replaced in FIX 4.3, Removed in FIX 4.4] Affected Volume 4: field removed from New Order – Single, Order Cancel/Replace Request (aka Order Modification Request), and New Order List messages. The Rule80A field (known prior to FIX 4.2 as "Rule80A" and in FIX 4.2 as "Rule80A (aka OrderCapacity)") was deprecated and replaced in FIX 4.3 by the combined use of the new to FIX 4.3 OrderCapacity and Order Restrictions fields. The Rule80A field was removed in FIX 4.4. The "(aka OrderCapacity)" designation has been removed from the Rule80A field. Mapping of the replaced Rule80A field's values is as follows:

| Replaced Field                                                     | OrderCapacity (528) |

# 15.

Replaced value: "A = T+1" with value with "2 = Next Day (T+1)" in SettlmntTyp (tag 63) field [Replaced in FIX 4.4]. The value "A = T+1" was inadvertently added to the SettlmntType (tag 63) field in FIX 4.3, however, the FIX specification already specified "2 = Next Day" which is synonymous. FIX 4.4 removed the "A=T+1" value and added " (T+1)" suffix to the "Next Day" value for clarification.

# 16.

Replaced "Fixed Peg to Local best bid or offer at time of order" value from ExecInst (tag 18) Field [Replaced in FIX 4.4]. See "Volume 4 - Order Handling Instructions – pegged orders". Mapping of the removed ExecInst field's value is as follows:

| Replaced Value within ExecInst (18) field | PegMoveType (835)                               |   | PegScope (840) | ExecInst (18) |       |   |             |

# 17.

Removed unused field: RatioQty (tag 319) [Replaced in FIX 4.4]. RatioQty (tag 319) was no longer used by any FIX messages as of FIX version 4.3 designating it as "No longer used as of FIX 4.3". Note that FIX 4.3 replaced this field with LegRatioQty (tag 623).

# 18.

Removed unused field: SecDefStatus (tag 653) [Replaced in FIX 4.4]. SecDefStatus (653) was no longer used by any FIX messages as of FIX version 4.3 designating it as "No longer used as of FIX 4.3". Note that the FIX 4.3 draft process introduced this field, however, it was replaced with Security Definition messages prior to FIX 4.3 release.

Removed TotalVolumeTradedDate (tag 449) and TotalVolumeTradedTime (tag 450) fields [Replaced in FIX 4.4]. Removed TotalVolumeTradedDate (449) and TotalVolumeTradedTime (450) fields as FIX 4.4 specifies that MDEntryDate (272) and MDEntryTime (273) fields should be used instead.

# Appendix 6-G

# Use of &#x3C;Parties> Component Block: PartyRole, PartyIDSource, PartyID, and PartySubID

The &#x3C;Parties> component block (see "Volume 1: Common Components of Application Messages") is a flexible structure that allows new party "roles" or types, party identification and identification schemes to be added without a corresponding increase in the number of FIX fields with the use of PartyRole, PartyID and PartyIDSource fields. Optionally, further information on a party identified in PartyID can be specified in the repeating group of PartySubID and PartySubIDType fields. The PartySubIDType field can be used to identify the type of PartySubID value (i.e. "Firm", "Phone number", "Contact name", "Full legal name of firm", etc.).

The matrix below identifies the various PartyRole values and the anticipated PartyIDSource values which may be associated with each PartyRole. It is important to note that other combinations may exist. In addition, see “Volume 7 – Products” for any documented product-specific anticipated PartyRole mapping and guidance.

# Appendix 6-H

# Use of &#x3C;SettlInstructions> Component Block

# Introduction

The SettlInstructions component block is used to transmit settlement instruction details on an Allocation Instruction, Allocation Report, Confirmation or Settlement Instruction message.

When used on an Allocation Instruction, Allocation Report or Confirmation message, this represents the settlement instructions that apply to a particular trade or order.

When used on a Settlement Instruction message, this represents either standing instructions (to be used on future trades) or the instructions for a specific order (this usage is intended for the retail CIV market).

This component block can be used either to contain full settlement instruction details (i.e. settlement agent identities and account numbers) or a reference to a standing instruction database.

When used to refer to instructions held on a standing instructions database, the StandInstDbType, StandInstDbName and StandInstDbID fields are used to specify the identify and name of the standing instructions database, and the identifier of the standing instruction record within that database. The NoDlvyInst repeating group should not be populated when using these fields.

When used to specify settlement instruction details, the NoDlvyInst repeating group is used. Each member of that group holds one party's instructions for cash or securities settlement (or both in the case of DVP). The SettlInstSource field identifies to whom the instructions belong, and the DlvyInstType field identifies whether the instructions are for securities or for cash.

In both of these cases, the SettlDeliveryType field is used to identify the type of settlement being represented by these settlement instructions, i.e. DVP (delivery vs payment), FOP (free of payment), hold in custody etc.

Where the component block is used to describe specific settlement instructions (i.e. using the NoDlvyInst repeating group), the number of entries in the NoDlvyInst repeating group is determined by the contents of the SettlDeliveryType field and the context of the message block (i.e. which message it is in).

When used in an Allocation Instruction, Allocation Report or Settlement Instruction message, only the settlement instructions for the party generating the message need be specified. On a Confirmation message, both parties to the trade will have their settlement instructions specified. The matrix of usage of the NoDlvyInst repeating group is therefore as follows:

| Allocation Instruction, Allocation Report or Settlement Instruction | SettlDeliveryType | NoDlvyInst                                                                                                    | SettlInstSource                                                                                               | DlvyInstType   |

The actual instructions themselves are held within the SettlParties component block inside the NoDlvyInst repeating group. This contains a repeating group of party identifiers and sub ids which is used to hold the identifiers of all parties involved in settlement (e.g. agent, custodian, depository) together with any required account numbers, registration details or similar.

# Delivery Instruction Formatting &#x26; Structure

# Parties &#x26; Party Sub-IDs

FIX supports the concept of a “SettlParty”, this being an organisation or individual connected in some way to the settlement of a financial transaction. Every SettlParty has a role (defining what the SettlParty is doing), an identifier, SettlPartyID (with a SettlPartyIDSource to identify the type of SettlPartyID) and any number of sub-identifiers (SettlPartySubID), each with a SettlPartySubIDType to define the type of sub-identifier.

For the purposes of settlement instruction definition, the party sub-identifiers can be taken to represent one of three things:

- An alternative identifier for the SettlParty. For example, if the SettlParty’s primary identifier is its BIC (expressed through its SettlPartyID with SettlPartyIDSource = B for BIC) then any other identifiers for the SettlParty (e.g. CSD participant number) can be expressed using a SettlPartySubID. For every SettlPartyIDSource that is commonly used to identify a SettlParty for settlement purposes, there is an equivalent SettlPartySubIDType.

© Copyright, 2008-20092011, FIX Protocol, Limited                                                    Page 476 of 482

Version 5.0 Service Pack 2 - Errata    VOLUME 6                                                    August 18, 2011

An identifier of an account held at the SettlParty. Note that the convention is to hold the account details under the SettlParty at which the account is held, rather than under the SettlParty on whose behalf the account is held. For example, the account number of a custodian at an agent is held as a SettlPartySubID under the SettlParty representing the agent, not the custodian.

Additional information relating to the SettlParty, e.g. its full name, address, contact name, phone number etc.

When using the FIX SettlInstructions component block, it may be appropriate to provide a number of identifiers for the same SettlParty (e.g. both the BIC and CREST id for a CREST member agent bank). Only one of these can be held as a SettlPartyID – the other(s) must be held as SettlPartySubID(s). It does not matter which is held where.

# Mapping FIX to ISO15022

It is important to note that the ISO15022 standard has a consistent set of codes for what in FIX terms would be called the SettlPartyIDSource (or SettlPartySubIDType for sub-identifiers). Examples include:

- C – Country code
- P – Qualifier (BIC/BEI)
- R – Data Source Scheme/Proprietary Code
- Q – Name and address
- S – Alternate ID

In the interests of assuring STP, FIX fields and messages only map to ISO15022 options C, P or R (with a strong preference for P - BIC wherever possible). There is no equivalent of ‘Q’ in FIX at the SettlParty level, though this is supported at SettlPartySubID level.

The ISO 15022 standard uses a similar methodology to the component blocks in FIX. This means that the same ISO tag can be used many times in the same message but its meaning depends on which message ‘sequence’ it is in. This is equivalent to the FIX concept of SettlPartyRole. For example, a PSET BIC should be represented in FIX using these tags:

| FIX Tag                | Value    |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| 782 SettlPartyID       | CEDELULL |
| 783 SettlPartyIDSource | B        |
| 784 SettlPartyIDRole   | 10       |

The mapping to a SWIFT tag would work here as follows:

1. FIX tag 782 is a SettlPartyID and therefore maps to SWIFT tag 95 (Party)
2. FIX tag 783 shows that the SettlPartyIDSource is a BIC and therefore maps to SWIFT option P.

We can now derive the correct SWIFT tag as 95P, which takes the format :Tag::Qualifier//BIC, or in SWIFT shorthand ::4!c//4!a2!a2!c[3!c] (where [3!c] represents the XXX characters at the end of an 8-character BIC). So, concatenating the values within, or implied by, the FIX tags the mapping is:

# Notes on CSD Identifiers

ISO15022 allows a CSD identifier to be specified along with the type of identifier being used. For example:

:95R::DEAG/CRST/636 - Tag(Option):: (Qualifier)/(Data Source Scheme)/(Proprietary Code)

Here, the various tags have the following meanings:

- 95 (Tag) = PARTY
- R (Option) = The party will be identified by a data source scheme/ proprietary code
- DEAG (Qualifier) = Deliverer’s agent
- CRST (Data Source Scheme) = Crest
- 636 (Proprietary Code) = participant ID at Crest.

In order to avoid having the full set of CSD identifier types listed as separate enumerations of PartyIDSource/PartySubIDType, FIX treats all such identifiers simply as CSD participant/member codes (PartyIDSource = H, PartySubIDType = 17). The type of participant/member code (e.g. Euroclear vs. DTC vs. CREST etc.) can be derived simply by looking at the instruction’s settlement location (PartyRole = 10 – equivalent to ISO15022 PSET). This is illustrated in the example below.

Investor IDs are represented by a completely separate SettlParty with a SettlPartyRole of 5 (investor id).

# Notes on use of Settlement Location (PSET) and Trade Matching

One of the strengths of the FIX 4.4 post-execution process is the ability to enrich messages with PSET or full settlement details. This will allow brokers to match the buy-side’s PSET for “settlement channel compatibility” prior to the confirmation process. Brokers will compare the PSET on the buy-side’s Allocation Instruction with their default PSET for the security in question and, if the match is not exact, they will use their own proprietary logic to determine whether or not to support a “bridge” between the 2 PSETs. All participants are strongly encouraged to use the BIC for sending PSET information. This matching logic closely mimics that proposed by the GSTPA model and has the advantage of alerting parties to potential settlement issues well before instructions are sent to the market. For similar reasons, buy-side firms are encouraged to include net money calculations on their allocations.

# Notes on Relational Integrity and Compatibility with ISO15022

Version 5.0 Service Pack 2 - Errata VOLUME 6 August 18, 2011

The FIX 4.4 post-execution messages have been designed to be compatible with the ISO15022 standard. To ensure that all parties can translate a FIX message into a SWIFT message without ambiguity, it is essential that the information on Allocation Instructions and Confirmations conforms to certain relational integrity rules. This is particularly applicable to the data within the component blocks. The ability to use these blocks to define any number of parties gives considerable flexibility, but there are certain pitfalls. The same SettlPartyIDRole should never repeat within the same &#x3C;SettlParties> block. For example, this slightly contrived combination would be allowed because even though the values in SettlPartyID and SettlPartyIDSource are identical, the values of tag 784 (784=30 and 783=27) are unique.

| Tag | Field Name         |
| --- | ------------------ |
| 781 | NoSettlPartyIDs    |
| 782 | SettlPartyID       |
| 783 | SettlPartyIDSource |
| 784 | SettlPartyRole     |

27 Buyer/Seller (receiver/deliverer)

However, this equally contrived combination would not be allowed because the values in SettlPartyRole are identical (784= 4 and 784=4) even though the BICs are different.
